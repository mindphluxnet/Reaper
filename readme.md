## Reaper - A Classic Hardcore death log addon

A simple extension for the Hardcore addon, this addon displays information about any Hardcore death on the server cluster (not just in your own guild). It also collects
this information for whatever it may be good for and reminds the player every 30 minutes to use ```/reload``` to save their progress.

You can also use the slash command
```/reaper audit```
to display the Hardcore addon version for all guild members.
