## Reaper - A Classic Hardcore companion addon

Reaper is meant as a companion addon to Hardcore, adding the following features:

- displays the death log of any Hardcore character on your faction and server cluster, not just those in your own guild
- adds a slash command ```/reaper audit``` which displays Hardcore addon version information for your entire guild
- adds a slash command ```/reaper inspect``` which displays a summary about the targeted character if it has the Hardcore addon running
- displays a reminder to use ```/reload``` every 30 minutes and then every 5 minutes until the reload is performed
- displays a warning when the player accepts a quest requiring a profession they don't have
- remembers the highest level you got per class and displays a new personal record on level up
